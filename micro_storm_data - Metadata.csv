,id,unique code to indentify each sample,,categorical ,NA,"For each code, the first two letters correspond to a microhabitat location (RC=reefcrest; RF=reef flat, SF=sand flat; RS=reef slope). The next character corresponds to the treatment (N=pre_storm; T=treatment). Lastly is a unique identifying number ",
,trait_date,date that metrics/traits were performed DDMonthYYYY,,,NA,The date that traits were measured in the lab on the pre_storms or the post_storms.,
,treatment,pre_storm or post_storm,,categorical,NA,Identifies which samples were collected before the storm or after the storm ,
,microhabitat,"the unique microhabitat Padina samples are collected from or transplanted to (sandflat, reefflat, reefcrest, reefslope)",,categorical ,NA,"The reef habitat in which the individual was either a pre_storm of or transplanted to. The four habitats we used were the sand flat (SF), reef flat (RF), reef crest (RC), and the reef slope (RS). The sand flat is the habitat before the reef characterized by a flat area of sand. The reef flat is the horizontal, relatively shallow area of the reef. The reef crest is the area of the reef before the vertical drop of the slope. The reef slope is the habitat that is completely submerged after the reef crest which faces the open ocean. ",
,collection_date,date that the Padina is collected DDMonthYYYY,,,,The date in which the particular sample is collected from the reef,
METRIC ,ww,wet weight,,numeric,grams,individual padina was placed within a nylon sock and spun at a rate of one pump per a second for 60 seconds,
TRAIT/METRIC,h,height,,numeric,centimeters,"Padina is laid on a sheet, then is measured from bottom of the holdfast to the longest blade.",
TRAIT,h:ww,ratio of height of thallus to wet weight of thallus,,numeric,cm/gram,Calculated by dividing height of individual by weight of individual ,
METRIC ,v,volume,,numeric,mL ,"Padina is placed into a 1000ml graduated cylinder, pre-volume and post-volumes are recorded to determine change in volume ",
METRIC ,pre_volume,volume of the graduated cylinder before algae individual was placed inside ,,numeric,mL ,graduated cyclinder was filled with water and the amount was recorded,
METRIC ,post_volume ,volume of the graduated cylinder after algae individual was placed inside ,,numeric,mL ,"Padina is placed inside the graduated cylinder, fully submerged, and the water level was recorded .",
TRAIT,dw:ww,ratio of thallus dry weight to thallus wet weight,,numeric,NA,Calculated by dividing the weight of the individual after being dried in a drying oven for two days by its weight before being dried,
METRIC ,dw_thallus,dry weight of the thallus ,,numeric,grams,Dry weight of the entire individual calculated by proportioning the weight of the subsample (ww_subsB) to the entire thallus. (Dry weight subsample B * Wet weight thallus)/(Wet weight subsample B),
,foil_weight,weight of the foil which holds the subsample,,numeric,grams,Measured before the subsample was placed inside in order to calculate dry weight later on,
,ww_subsB,wet weight of the subsample used for dry weight ,,numeric,grams,The weight of the subsample before being dried. This was later used to calculate dry weight of the entire thallus (dw_thallus) using proportions.,
,foilanddw_subsB,weight of the foil pouch and the subsample it contains,,numeric,grams,The total weight of the foil & dried subsample after being in the drying oven for two days,
,dw_subsB,dry weight of the subsample ,,numeric,grams,Calculated by subtracting the total weight of the foil & dried subsample (foilanddw_subsB) by the foil weight (foil_weight),
TRAIT,sa:dw,ratio of surface area of thallus to dry weight of thallus,,numeric,cm^2/gram,Calculated by dividing the surface area of an individual by the dry weight of the individual,
METRIC,ww_subsA,wet weight of the subsample of thallus used for surface area calculations,,numeric,grams ,Used to later proportion the surface area of the subsample to the entire thallus. ,
METRIC ,sa_subsA,surface area of the subsample,,numeric,cm^2,Laid subsample flat on a sheet of paper with no overlap or folding before taking a level photograph with a ruler in view for scale. Used ImageJ to outline subsample and calculate the area.,
METRIC ,sa_thallus,surface area of the entire thallus,,numeric,cm^2,Surface area of the entire individual calculated by proportioning the weight of the subsample (ww_subsA) to the entire thallus. (Surface area subsample A * Wet weight thallus)/(Wet weight subsample A),
TRAIT,sa:v,ratio of surface area of thallus to volume of thallus,,numeric,cm^2/mL,Calculated by dividing the surface area of an individual by the volume of the individual,
METRIC,p_calcification,percent of thallus that is calcified,,numeric,NA,"Blade is wet weighed, placed in acid, then re-weighed. Percent calcification is represented by the percent of mass lost after placing the blade in acid. When the weight of the pre-calcified sample and post-calcified sample was the same, we substracted half of the lowest detection unit (SFN23)",
,precalc_subsA,wet weight of the subsample before placed in acid,,numeric,grams,The weight of the subsample before being placed in acid,
,postcalc_subsA,wet weight of the subsample after removed from acid,,numeric,grams,The weight of the subsample after being placed in acid,
TRAIT/METRIC,ts,tensile strength ,,numeric,grams,"Padina is tested with a spring scale. A rubber band is attached to the holdfast of the padina and then it is pulled to determine how many grams of force it takes to break the blades from the holdfast. When the blades broke with force undetectable by the spring scale, we substracted half of the lowest detection unit (RSN2, RSN11, SFT2)",
TRAIT/METRIC,t,toughness,,numeric,grams,The amount of weight needed to penatrate the top layer of the newest growth region of the blade. Performed by using a penatrometer and slowly adding sand until the top layer of the blade was penatrated. Calculated by adding the mass of the sand (weigh boat & sand - weigh boat) and the weight of the penatrometer. ,
,weigh_boat,weight of the weigh boat,,numeric,grams,The weight of the weigh boat. This was later used during calculations to omit the weigh boat's weight.,
,boat_and_sand,weight of the sand and the weigh boat ,,numeric,grams,The combined weight of the amount of sand used to penetrate the blade and the weigh boat. This value was then used to determine the amount of sand by subtracting the weigh_boat value,
,penatrometer_weight,weight of the penatrometer alone,,numeric,grams,The weight of the penatrometer itself. This was later added to the amount of sand to determine the toughness of the blade ,
